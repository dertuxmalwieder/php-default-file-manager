Using this script, you can easily assign your folders to any file manager, even to those which don't actually support it by default. Two .reg files (compatible with Windows 2000 and newer) will be created, one that associates all folders with your chosen file manager and one that restores the Windows Explorer associations if something went wrong. To apply them, perform a double-click on them.

Note that I can't take any responsibility for possible errors when using the .reg files. Read your favorite file manager's manual if you don't know the exact parameters!

Your generated files will be kept for 3 days.
